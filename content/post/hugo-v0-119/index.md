Longevity isn't just about genetics—**up to 80% of lifespan variance is influenced by lifestyle choices**.  
Here are **five research-backed habits** that can help you live longer and healthier:  

### 1. Strength Training & Daily Movement
- Strength training **twice a week** can reduce all-cause mortality by **10–20%** (*JAMA Network Open, 2022*).  
- Walking **7,000–10,000 steps per day** lowers premature death risk by **50%** (*JAMA, 2021*).  

### 2. Follow a Mediterranean Diet
- A Mediterranean diet (rich in olive oil, fish, nuts, and whole foods) lowers heart disease risk by **30%** (*NEJM, 2013*).  
- High polyphenol intake reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, slowing aging processes.  

### 3. Prioritize Sleep & Circadian Health
- **7–9 hours of quality sleep** reduces chronic disease risk and promotes longevity (*Harvard Medical School*).  
- Aligning sleep with **natural light cycles** improves metabolism and cardiovascular health.  

### 4. Practice Intermittent Fasting (IF) or Caloric Restriction
- IF and caloric restriction promote **cellular repair, mitochondrial function, and longevity** (*Cell Metabolism, 2018*).  
- The **16:8 fasting method** (fasting for 16 hours, eating in an 8-hour window) can improve metabolic health.  

### 5. Maintain Strong Social Connections
- Studies show loneliness is as **deadly as smoking 15 cigarettes per day** (*PLOS Medicine, 2010*).  
- People with **strong social connections** live up to **10 years longer** (*Blue Zones Research*).  

## Key Takeaway
By making **simple, research-backed adjustments**—moving more, eating whole foods, optimizing sleep, fasting, and fostering relationships—you can **increase both lifespan and healthspan** significantly.
